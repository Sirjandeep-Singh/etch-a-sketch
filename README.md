Etch-a-Sketch ðŸŽ¨
ðŸ‘‰ Live Demo

A simple Etch-a-Sketch built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was made as part of The Odin Project foundations course to practice DOM manipulation and Flexbox.

Features
16Ã—16 grid by default
Draw by hovering over squares
Resize the grid (up to 100Ã—100)
Clear button to reset the board
Rainbow mode (random colors)
Shading mode (square gets darker with each pass)
What I Learned
Creating elements dynamically with JavaScript
Handling events like mouseover and click
Using Flexbox to build a grid layout
Working with dataset to store state on elements
Keeping code modular and easy to extend
How to Run
Just open index.html in your browser, or check out the live demo.

Next Steps
Things I might add later:

A custom color picker
Eraser mode
Save sketch as an image
Better styling for mobile
